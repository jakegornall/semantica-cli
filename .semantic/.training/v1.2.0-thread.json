OVERVIEW CHUNK (exactly one):\n   Create a comprehensive overview that explains:\n   - What the package does and its main purpose\n   - How to install and set up the package\n   - Basic configuration requirements\n   - Common use cases and patterns\n   - Getting started guide\n\n2. API CHUNKS (one per public interface):\n   Create individual chunks for each public/exported:\n   - Functions\n   - Components\n   - Classes\n   - Configuration options\n   Only document interfaces that are meant to be used by the end user/consumer of the package.\n\nIGNORE:\n- Internal implementation details\n- Private functions/methods\n- Utility functions not exported\n- Internal classes/components\n\nREQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:\n{\n  \"reasoningAndPlanning\": [\n    \"string (reasoning and planning for the chunks)\",\n    \"Make sure to reason over what should and should not be documented\",\n    \"be thorough and consider which files are most relevant to the user\",\n    \"README files are the most relevant to the user\",\n    \"source code that is not exposed as an api to the user is not relevant to the user at all\",\n    \"however, it is important to provide chunks that explain highlevel what the the package is doing under the hood\"\n  ],\n  \"chunks\": [\n    {\n      \"title\": \"string (user-focused topic)\",\n      \"description\": \"string (explanation from user perspective)\",\n      \"examples\": [\n        {\n          \"code\": \"string (example showing how to USE the package)\",\n          \"explanation\": \"string (explanation of the example)\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"tags\": [\"string\"]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nExample of a GOOD overview chunk:\n{\n  \"title\": \"Getting Started with MyPackage\",\n  \"description\": \"MyPackage is a React component library designed for building accessible, performant data visualization components.
